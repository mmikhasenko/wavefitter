Repository combines the followin components:
  - A library which provides a tool to fit data (RelationHolder and ParameterKeeper).
  - Implementation of physics-methods (K-matrix, Production process, Unitarisation, Deck projection)
  - Program to fit the compass PW-data. It works based on confiburation file.

Requirements:
  - cmake >= 3.5 (likely it works even with older version but has not been checked)
  - gcc >= 4.7 to support c++11 (mainly lambda functions)
  - boost >= 1.53 (ublas is used for matrix calculations)
  - libconfig 
  - ROOT

Installation:

1. Install required packages. 
One can check version with the following commands (centos 7).
[] cmake --version
[] yum list installed | grep boost
[] gcc --version
[] root-config --version


2. Install wavefitter
[] git clone https://Misha_Mikhasenko@bitbucket.org/Misha_Mikhasenko/wavesfitter.git wavesfitter
[] cd wavesfitter
[] mkdir build
[] cmake ..
[] make
